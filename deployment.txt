# Clone Source Code from Git - One Time
git clone https://github.com/timbrown-phs/proxy-auth
cd proxy-auth

# Refresh artifacery repo - After Code Changes
cd proxy-auth
git fetch
git pull origin main

docker build -t us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1 .
docker images

# Run a Docker container using an image that is stored in Google Cloud Artifact Registry.
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1

## Set up Cloud Run service
#Configure Docker to Use gcloud as a Credential Helper
gcloud auth configure-docker
# Tag your image with the registryâ€™s URL
docker tag us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/app-pc-hospice/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1 gcr.io/app-pc-hospice/us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/app-pc-hospice/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1
# Push your Docker image to Google Container Registry:
docker push gcr.io/app-pc-hospice/us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/app-pc-hospice/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1

# Deploy to Google Cloud Run
#Setup config for google rung
gcloud components update 
gcloud config set run/platform managed
gcloud config set run/region us-east1
#Deploy your image to Cloud Run by running:
gcloud run deploy proxy-auth-service --image gcr.io/app-pc-hospice/us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/app-pc-hospice/app-pc-hospice-repo/proxy-auth:v1 --allow-unauthenticated
* deployment will fail because default port for container is 8080 so manually go into cloud run and update service port to 8000
